DBL Project Group 34:

The tool is available at: https://aerelion.github.io/DBL-Project/#/fileupload
The source code can also be found at: https://github.com/Aerelion/DBL-Project

A dataset can be uploaded using the file input mechanism. Only ".csv" files can be uploaded. A name can be given to the uploaded dataset, otherwise the name of the dataset will be "null". After the dataset is uploaded successfully, a message indicating this will pop up. A refresh is required after the dataset is uploaded for the newly uploaded dataset to pop up in the dataset column. Any of the previous datasets can be visualised by clicking the button labeled "visualise". A visualisation on a black background canvas will pop up. Zoom/dragging functionality is implemented in the visualisiation. The whole visualisation can be viewed by zooming into and dragging into other parts of the visualisation. Performance could be bad while visualising the complete dataset due to lack of optimizations. This will be fixed in the final software with optimizations.

The "Home" and "About" page are placeholders for the prototype. The only functional and important page is the "File Upload" page. Everything required for the prototype can be found in this page.
